# Inference Log

Hydra's database stores all classifications. The classifications and the corresponding images can be viewed at any time. The Log page functions as a report that can be used during Run Coordinator meetings to give diagnostics about the detector systems for the previous day. In addition, you can filter and view plots by date time and run number. 

These reports can also be emailed if a detector expert has opted in to receiving emails from Hydra.
