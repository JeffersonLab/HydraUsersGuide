# Image Labeler

Hydra provides a web-based image labeler to take advantage of supervised learning. Here, users can select the images to label and the specific label they want to apply using the dropdown selector and the button group, respectively. 

Once the image and corresponding label are chosen, clicking on the header block of each image will assign the chosen label to that image. 

**Do not forget to hit the apply labels button!**
